Server settings.

The API key belongs to whoever runs the server, not to the visitor, so every
limit here exists to bound what a visitor can spend on their behalf.

Everything below is read from `settings.env` at the moment it is asked for, so
`settings.DAILY_REQUEST_BUDGET` is the number in that file right now — raising it
takes effect on the next request, with a translation still running. The two
constants are the exceptions, and both describe where the process lives rather
than how it behaves: they cannot change without a restart anyway.
