"""
Pacing a run against the API's per-minute limits.

Two rolling one-minute windows, one counting requests and one counting tokens.
A worker asks for a slot and is held until both windows have room for it.

Three things here are load-bearing:

- **The slot is taken inside the lock that finds room for it.** Finding room and
  then recording the use of it as separate steps lets every worker pass the
  check before any of them has recorded anything, so the limit holds only while
  the pool happens to be no larger than the limit itself. It did happen to be —
  `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` sizes both — which is not a thing to rely on.

- **Attempts are counted, not successes.** A request answered with 429 was still
  a request. Recording only successes meant a key with nothing left was asked
  ten times in about two seconds, each one refused, with no pause between them.

- **`back_off` exists for when the server disagrees anyway.** Its limits are the
  real ones and ours are a guess at them, so a 429 is the authoritative answer
  and holds every worker, not just the one that got it.
