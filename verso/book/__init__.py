"""
The EPUB itself: reading one, the chapters it is made of, and writing the
translated copy back out.

Everything here needs an archive to work on. The judgement of what language a
book is written in does not — it reads plain text — so it lives a level up in
`language_detection.py`, beside `token_counting.py`, and is imported by the
reader and the server alike.
