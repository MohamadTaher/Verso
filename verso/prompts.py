The prompt sent for one patch of chapters.

CHAPTER_SEPARATOR, the instruction to preserve it, and the split that reads it
back all live here together, for the same reason the glossary marker lives next
to its parser: they are parts of one contract. Spelled out in two files, a
change to one alone leaves the model dutifully keeping a marker nothing looks
for any more, and every patch silently collapses into its first chapter.

The sections are ordered so that everything shaping the reply sits as close to
the reply as possible: what the book is, then how to translate it, then the
glossary, then the exact shape of the answer, then the input. The glossary
section states its own two rules — use these translations, report the new ones —
so the instruction list does not restate them.

# GOAL
Your goal is to translate the book from {source} to {target_lang}. The final translation must read as if it were originally written in {target_lang}, while remaining completely faithful to the source's style, tone, and meaning.

# HOW TO TRANSLATE
- **Idioms & Culturalisms:** Do not translate idioms literally. Find the closest equivalent cultural idiom in {target_lang}. If no direct equivalent exists, convey the original meaning in a natural-sounding way.
- **Duplicated text:** If you see duplicate text (like "Chapter 1: Title Chapter 1: Title"), translate it only once.

# THE HTML
- Reproduce every tag and attribute exactly as it stands. Do not add, remove or alter any of them.
- Translate only the text between the tags.
- Leave HTML comments (`<!-- ... -->`) exactly as they are, in the original characters. They are notes to the program reading your reply, not words of the book, so they are never translated and never reworded.
