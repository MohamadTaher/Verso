Talking to Gemini, and making sense of what comes back.

Nothing here holds any state or knows what a chapter is. It exists because the
interesting part of a failed request is *whether asking again could possibly
help*, and getting that wrong is expensive in both directions: retrying a
refusal spends ten requests to be told the same thing ten times, and giving up
on a hiccup loses a patch that would have worked on the second try.
