"""
Running a translation: planning it, pacing it, and saving as it goes.

`prepare` works out what a run would cost without spending anything, and `run`
carries out a plan. They are separate because the server shows a reader the plan
and waits for them to agree to it; the CLI joins them back together in
`translate_book`.

A *patch* is a group of chapters translated together, and that is what it is
called throughout — in the code, in the events, and in what a reader is shown.
"Request" is reserved for the API call: `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` of them go out at
once, the daily budget counts them, and a patch that retries spends several. The
book is re-saved after every patch that lands, so a run that dies halfway leaves
a readable book behind.

The parts that are their own subject live next door: `translation_plan.py` works
out what a run would involve, `patch_worker.py` carries out one patch,
`run_state.py` holds the counters they share, and `gemini.py` judges whether a
failed attempt is worth repeating.
