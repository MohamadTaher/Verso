What a translation would do, worked out before any of it is paid for.

Kept apart from the run itself because the server shows a reader this and then
waits: nothing here calls the API or changes a chapter, so a plan can be built,
discarded and built again as a reader changes their mind about which chapters to
translate.

    Work out what translating this book would involve, without calling the API.

    By default, chapters detected as already translated are left out. Pass
    `only_chapter_ids` to translate exactly the chapters named instead.

    Safe to call more than once on the same book: `source.chapters()` hands back
    fresh objects every time, so re-planning never inherits a previous plan's
    state.

    The returned `source_language` is what the book turned out to be written in.
    Detection happens inside `source.chapters` and nowhere else, so this is the
    one moment "auto" becomes a language name, and the caller is expected to keep
    it — a translator that goes on holding "auto" asks the model to translate
    "from auto". A book in a Latin script stays "auto"; the prompt words that
    case for itself.
