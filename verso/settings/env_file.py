"""
The settings file, re-read whenever it changes.

`.env` holds the API key. A key is a secret, it is set once, and reading it
again would never give a different answer — so it stays there and is read at
startup like any other secret.

Everything else is a number someone tunes *while the server is running*: how
fast to translate, what a visitor may spend, how large an upload may be. Those
live here, in a file this module re-reads as soon as its timestamp moves, so
changing one takes effect without a restart — and a restart would abandon any
translation in flight, which is the whole reason to avoid needing one.

Same syntax as `.env`, parsed by the same library, so there is one format to
learn. It is deliberately **not** loaded into `os.environ`: a value there is
read once and cannot be told apart from a real environment variable, which is
exactly the two properties this file exists to avoid.

Whoever asks for a setting gets the value as of that call, so ask late — read
`server.settings.TOKENS_PER_REQUEST` where it is used, not into a module constant, or
the setting is frozen at import and none of this does anything.
