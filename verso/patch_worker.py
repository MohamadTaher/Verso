"""
One patch: the chapters going into it, the prompt built around them, and what
becomes of the reply.

This is where a run spends its money, and where the decision to spend it again
is made — a failed attempt is repeated only while repeating it can help, which
`gemini.py` judges.

A group of chapters is a *patch*, in the code and in what a reader is told
alike. "Request" is kept for the API call itself — the per-minute limit and the
daily budget count requests, and a patch that retries costs several of them, so
the two are not interchangeable even though the happy path sends one each.
