    The names and terms this book has settled on, shared by every worker.

    It starts as whatever the reader typed and grows as the book is translated:
    each response reports the terms it met, `merge` keeps the ones that are new,
    and `prompt_section` sends them back out with the later patches that mention
    them. That loop is the point — chapter 40 has to call a character what
    chapter 1 called them, and the model sees only one patch at a time.

    First translation wins. A term already settled keeps its translation however
    the model renders it later, because an inconsistent name is the one thing a
    glossary exists to prevent.

    Every worker thread reaches this object at once, so all of it is under one
    lock and callers only ever receive snapshots.
