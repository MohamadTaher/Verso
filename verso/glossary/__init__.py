"""
The glossary: terms this book translates the same way every time.

It is built during the run, not only before it. Every patch comes back with
the terms the model met in those chapters, they are merged in, and they travel
back out with the later patches that mention them — which is what keeps a
character's name from drifting between chapter 1 and chapter 40, when the model
only ever sees one patch at a time.

    terms.py           the Glossary itself: what is known, and how it grows
    model_protocol.py  what the model is asked for, and the parser for its reply
    relevance.py       which terms are worth sending with a given patch
    storage.py         the file on disk, and the one definition of its format
