"""
Grouping chapters into patches — one patch is one API request, holding as many
chapters as fit under the token limit.

A patch is what it is called everywhere, including in the UI. "Request" means
the API call it becomes — the thing the rate limit and the budget count. See CLAUDE.md.

Kept apart from the EPUB itself because the server packs a plan it has already
read: re-costing a reader's chapter selection goes through `pack_by_tokens`
without touching a book on disk.

    selection would take without re-reading the book. Both paths must pack
    identically, or the count shown to a reader would not be the count they are
    charged for — so this rule lives here and nowhere else.

    An item larger than the limit still gets a patch of its own; splitting a
    chapter mid-way would break the translation, so an oversized patch is the
