# Verso

Translates EPUB books with Google's Gemini API, keeping names and terminology
consistent from the first chapter to the last.

That consistency is the hard part. A book is far too large to translate in one
request, so it goes out in patches of a few chapters — and the model has no memory
of what it called a character thirty chapters ago. So every reply carries a second
payload: a glossary of the terms that patch met. Those merge into a running glossary
and travel back out with later requests whose chapters mention them, which is the
only thing keeping a name steady across a forty-chapter novel.

The rest follows from doing that carefully: HTML structure is preserved tag for tag,
replies are validated against the expected chapter count before they are accepted,
and the book is re-saved after every patch so a partial translation is always a
valid EPUB.

Runs two ways: a CLI, and a web app you can deploy.

## Setup

There are two files, split by how often they change.

**`.env` — your API key, and nothing else.** Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Get a key at <https://aistudio.google.com/apikey>. A key is a secret and it never
changes while the process runs, so it is read once at startup. Both the CLI and the
server read this same file. It is gitignored and never copied into the Docker image.

**`settings.env` — everything else, live.** This one is in the repo already, with
every setting commented and set to a working value. The model, the pace, the spend
ceilings and the upload limit all live here, and **the file is re-read whenever it
changes** — no restart, and no rebuild:

```
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.5-flash-lite
REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=4
DAILY_REQUEST_BUDGET=200
```

`gemini-3.1-pro` gives the best translations, but **it has no free tier** — on a key
without billing enabled every request comes back `429`, and a run retries ten times
before failing. `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` is the default for that reason: it works on a
free key, and is far cheaper and faster for testing.

The CLI's `--model` flag overrides this for a single run, and the server reports the
model in use from `GET /api/status`.

Each setting is read at the moment it is used, which is what "live" amounts to in
practice:

| Change | When it applies |
|---|---|
| `DAILY_REQUEST_BUDGET`, `MINUTES_BETWEEN_TRANSLATIONS`, `MAX_UPLOAD_MB`, `DELETE_UPLOADS_AFTER_MINUTES` | the next request |
| `TOKENS_PER_REQUEST` | the next book analysed — it decides how chapters are grouped |
| `GEMINI_MODEL`, `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE` | the next run started; one already going keeps the pace it began with |
| `MAX_TRANSLATIONS_AT_ONCE` | at once when lowered. Raising it accepts more uploads, but the thread pool was sized at startup, so the extra runs queue until a restart |

`settings.env` wins over an environment variable of the same name, which is the
reverse of how `.env` works. The file is the one being edited, so it takes precedence;
an environment variable is only the fallback for a setting the file says nothing
about, which means setting one for a name the file *does* mention has no effect at
all. `settings.env` is committed and copied into the image — it is configuration
rather than a secret. `.env` is the secret, and it is gitignored and never enters the
image.

**Neither file ever needs a rebuild.** `.env` needs a restart of the Python service —
the dev server does not read it:

```
docker compose restart verso
```

## Web app

```
docker compose up --build
```

Then open <http://localhost:7860>. Compose mounts your `.env` into the container and
keeps the spend counter in a named volume.

Drop in an EPUB and you get its cover, title and author, then the plan: every chapter
in book order, grouped by the patch that will translate it, with chapters that are
already in the target language marked and left out. Ticking chapters re-costs the run
on the server, so the patch count and the grouping are always the real ones rather
than an estimate. Nothing is spent until you press start.

During a run the book is re-saved after every patch, so the download works part-way
through and gives you a valid EPUB of whatever is finished. Reloading the page picks
the run back up — the job id is in the URL.

The API key stays on the server. Translation is never driven from the browser.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/status` | Model, remaining budget, limits, cooldown, known languages |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs` | Upload an EPUB, get back an analysed plan |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/{id}/preview` | Re-cost a chapter selection; spends nothing |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/{id}/start` | Confirm the plan and begin translating |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/{id}/events` | Server-sent progress events for the whole run |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/{id}/cover` | The book's cover art, when it has any |
| `POST` | `/api/jobs/{id}/cancel` | Stop after in-flight patches finish |
| `GET` | `/api/jobs/{id}/download` | Translated EPUB, valid mid-run too |
| `GET`/`PUT` | `/api/jobs/{id}/glossary` | Read and replace glossary terms |

A run outlives any single request, so progress arrives only on the event stream.

Because the key stays server-side, this needs a real host and can't run on static
hosting like GitHub Pages.

### Deploying

Any host that can run the Docker image will do. Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in the host's own configuration rather than shipping a `.env`, which is gitignored and never copied into the image.

#### Cloud Run

Deployment is continuous from GitHub. In the Cloud Run console choose **Continuously deploy from a repository**, connect this repo and set the branch to `main`. Every merge into `main` builds and rolls out a new revision, which makes `main` the live demo — work on a branch and merge once it is ready.

When it asks how to build, choose **Dockerfile**, not buildpacks. Buildpacks infer the language from `requirements.txt`, build the Python app alone and never run the `web/` build. The result is a working API serving no frontend, and because the build itself succeeds, nothing announces the problem.

The rest is set once on the service. These are properties of the service rather than of the repo, so every later deployment inherits them:

| Setting | Value | Why it is there |
|---|---|---|
| CPU allocation | always allocated | Translation runs on a background thread after `/start` has returned. Allocating CPU only during requests would leave the run frozen mid-book. |
| Maximum instances | `1` | Jobs live in one container's memory, and Cloud Run's session affinity is best-effort. A second instance would answer with jobs it has never heard of. |
| Request timeout | `3600` | The progress stream is one long-lived request. The five-minute default would sever it repeatedly; 60 minutes is the most Cloud Run allows. |
| Memory | `1 GiB` | The filesystem is in memory, so an upload is charged twice over — once as a file, once as RAM. |
| Authentication | allow unauthenticated | It is a public demo. |

Only two values are set on the service itself:

- **`GEMINI_API_KEY`**, referenced from Secret Manager rather than typed as a plain variable. It is the one value here that is a secret, and `.env` never enters the image.
- **`DATA_DIR=/tmp/verso`** as a plain environment variable, `/tmp` being the path guaranteed writable on any instance. The image points `DATA_DIR` at `/data` instead, which is where compose mounts its volume.

Everything else travels in the image. `settings.env` is committed and copied in, so the deployed model, pace and spend ceilings are whatever that file said when the image was built. Setting any of *those* names as an environment variable on the service does nothing — the file wins over the environment, by design.

No port needs configuring: Cloud Run sets `PORT` and the container listens on it, falling back to 7860 everywhere else.

Because the key belongs to whoever deploys it, every visitor spends the owner's money. These limits bound that, and they are the contents of `settings.env`:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DAILY_REQUEST_BUDGET` | `200` | API requests allowed per day across all visitors |
| `MINUTES_BETWEEN_TRANSLATIONS` | `30` | Minimum wait between runs from one address; `0` disables it |
| `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `25` | Largest accepted EPUB |
| `MAX_TRANSLATIONS_AT_ONCE` | `2` | Translations running at once |
| `DELETE_UPLOADS_AFTER_MINUTES` | `60` | How long an uploaded book is kept before deletion |

How a run is paced is set here too, rather than in the UI — a visitor spending
the owner's quota has no business tuning it:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` | `4` | Request rate, which is also how many run at a time |
| `TOKENS_PER_REQUEST` | `15000` | How much of the book goes into each request |
| `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE` | `250000` | The other half of the Gemini quota |

`REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE` is one number doing both jobs on purpose: requests take
tens of seconds, so a worker pool larger than the per-minute allowance would
only park threads inside the rate limiter.

Changing any of them on a deployed service is an edit to `settings.env` and a push:
the build carries the new file, and the revision that replaces the old one starts on
those values. Locally the same edit is live on the next request, with no restart and
no rebuild.

### Local development

`docker-compose.override.yml` is merged in automatically and turns `docker compose up`
into a development loop, still on <http://localhost:7860>. It mounts the working tree
over `/app` and runs uvicorn with `--reload`, so the container serves the code in this
directory rather than the copy baked into the image when it was built.

Nothing needs rebuilding to see a change. Python edits restart the server on their own,
and that port belongs to the Vite dev server, which builds the browser app itself and
forwards `/api` to uvicorn over the compose network — so a frontend edit updates the
open page, and a refresh always works. The image only has to be rebuilt when
`requirements.txt` or `package.json` change.

That mount is the one thing a deployed container will not have, and neither is the dev
server — deployed, uvicorn serves the built `web/dist` on that same port. To run what
would actually ship, leave the override out:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Without Docker at all:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn server.app:app --reload --port 7860
```

That serves the API, plus the last build of the frontend if `web/dist` exists — the
check happens at import, so build before starting.

For the UI with hot reload, run Vite alongside it; its dev server proxies `/api`
through to the one above, and is then the address to open:

```
cd web && npm install && npm run dev
```

## CLI

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python translate.py book.epub
```

Reads the key from the same `.env`. To use an environment variable instead:

```
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your-key-here"     # Windows (new shells)
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-key-here"   # macOS/Linux
```

Common options:

| Flag | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-o, --output` | Output path | `<input> (Translated).epub` |
| `--source-lang` | Source language | `auto` |
| `--target-lang` | Target language | `English` |
| `--glossary` | Glossary JSON file for consistent terms | none |
| `--model` | Gemini model name | `GEMINI_MODEL`, else `gemini-3.5-flash-lite` |
| `--requests-per-minute` | Request rate, which is also how many requests run at a time | `REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE`, else `4` |
| `--tokens-per-minute` | API token rate limit | `TOKENS_PER_MINUTE`, else `250000` |
| `--tokens-per-request` | Max tokens per request | `TOKENS_PER_REQUEST`, else `15000` |

The last four default to the same `.env` settings the server is paced by, so a
book runs at one speed however it is started; passing the flag overrides it.
Run `python translate.py --help` for the full list, which prints the
defaults your `.env` currently resolves to.

## How it works

1. Extracts chapters from the EPUB, skipping any already translated (see below).
2. Groups untranslated chapters into token-limited patches.
3. Translates patches concurrently via Gemini, injecting relevant glossary terms into each prompt and merging in the new terms each response reports.
4. Auto-saves the EPUB after every successful patch. `Ctrl+C` stops gracefully — in-flight patches finish and progress is saved before exit.

### Detecting already-translated chapters

A chapter counts as already translated when almost none of its text is still written in the source language's script. This lets you re-run a partial translation without paying to redo finished chapters.

It only works for languages written in a non-Latin script — Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek, Thai, Hindi. Spanish and English share an alphabet, so for Latin-script sources nothing is auto-skipped and every chapter is translated. Over-translating costs tokens; wrongly skipping would silently leave the book half done.

## Glossary

A JSON file mapping original terms to their translation, used to keep names/places consistent:

```json
{"道玄": "Dao Xuan"}
```

Pass it with `--glossary terms.json`, or edit it over the API at `/api/jobs/{id}/glossary` — edits mid-run apply to patches not yet sent. Only the entries a patch actually mentions are pulled into its prompt, so a long glossary doesn't cost tokens on every request.

**It fills itself in as the book is translated.** Each patch asks the model to
report whichever names and terms in those chapters it was not already given, and
they are merged into the glossary and travel back out with the later patches that mention them — which is
what keeps a character called the same thing in chapter 40 as in chapter 1, when
the model only ever sees one patch at a time. The first translation of a term
wins: once settled, a term keeps its translation however the model renders it
later. Terms you supplied yourself are settled from the start, so learning never
overrules you — except that a term you left with a blank translation counts as
one for us to fill in.

Learned terms are written back to the glossary file after each patch, so
`--glossary terms.json` accumulates across runs, and `GET /api/jobs/{id}/glossary`
returns what the run has learned so far. `PUT` replaces the *whole* glossary, so a
client that saves a list fetched before the run would drop what it learned; the web
app re-reads the server's copy inside every save and carries those terms over.

In the browser, the glossary panel appears once a book has been analysed and stays
through the run. **Import a file** to bring in a glossary from elsewhere — the one
the CLI writes, or one saved from an earlier book in the same series. Importing
merges rather than replaces, and what this book has already decided wins, so it can
never rename a character mid-way. **Export** hands the list back as the same kind of
file, which is how a series carries its names from one book to the next.

## Known limitations

- Jobs live in memory. Restarting the server loses whatever was in flight.
- The daily budget counter lives on disk, so it resets whenever the container is rebuilt or restarted.
- Token counts use OpenAI's `cl100k_base` tokenizer, so Gemini token totals and time estimates are approximate.
- The per-minute limits are enforced in this process only. Two runs started from two containers against one key will each keep to the limit and together exceed it.
- The first request after the container has been idle is slow.
