"""
Run the suites.

    python testing/run_all.py               # everything, ~8 API requests
    python testing/run_all.py --only api    # only the free half
    python testing/run_all.py --only translation

Run it inside the app container, where Python and the dependencies are:

    docker compose exec -T verso python /app/testing/run_all.py

Both suites retune `settings.env` as they go and put it back afterwards, so the
whole run happens under one override of its own: every upload leaves a job that
counts as active until it expires, and the capacity gate would otherwise start
refusing uploads part-way through a suite that makes a dozen of them.
