"""
What comes back out of the archive, checked without translating anything.

`EpubWriter` is asked to save chapters it was just handed, unchanged. Nothing
here calls the API — a book saved without a single word being translated should
come back byte-comparable in everything but its metadata, so anything that
differs is the writer's doing and can be found for free.

This is the one suite that reaches inside the app rather than talking to it over
HTTP: the writer is where a run's output is decided, and a defect here shows up
in every book the server produces.
